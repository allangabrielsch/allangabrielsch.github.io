Welcome to my website! My name is Allan G. Schweinfurth. I am a master’s student at the Technical University of Munich, specializing in Particle, Nuclear, and Astrophysics. Alongside my studies, I work as a research assistant at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics. My research focuses on time-delay cosmography, where I use gravitationally lensed quasars and supernovae to probe the expansion history of the Universe. By analyzing lensing time delays, I work on constraining key cosmological parameters, particularly the Hubble constant, and addressing current tensions in modern cosmology.
