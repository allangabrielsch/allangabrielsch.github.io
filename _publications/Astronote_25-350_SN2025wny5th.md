excerpt: 'A fifth, faint (r′≈24) point source near G2 in 2025 CFHT/MegaCam imaging of the strongly lensed SN 2025wny (SN Winny). Likely an additional, demagnified SN image arising from the system’s two-galaxy lens configuration.'

We have acquired imaging data of the strongly lensed SN 2025wny (SN Winny; ZTF25abnjznp; GOTO25gqt) with CFHT + MegaCam on 2025 November 21 (14:56 UTC). The observations were taken in the r' filter with an exposure time of 5 x 120s, under excellent seeing conditions (0.5-0.6" measured full width at half maximum). Difference imaging with an archival r'-band image taken with the CFHT + MegaCam in 2005 (Gwyn 2012, AJ, 143, 38) shows the four previously reported images of SN 2025wny (AstroNote 2025-296; Taubenberger et al. 2025, arXiv:2510.21694; Johannson et al. 2025, arXiv:2510.23533) and an additional point source at RA = 07:16:34.36, DEC = +38:21:09.3, about 0.5" to the north-east of the second deflector galaxy G2 (following the nomenclature in Taubenberger et al.). We measure an r'-band magnitude of around 24.

Further investigation on the nature of this point source is needed. For the time being, the most likely explanation is that it constitutes a fifth, possibly demagnified image of SN 2025wny. The occurrence of a fifth image can be a consequence of the complex lensing configuration with two deflector galaxies at the same redshift.
