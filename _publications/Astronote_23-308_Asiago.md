The Asiago Transient Classification Program (Tomasella et al. 2014, AN, 335, 841) reports the spectroscopic observation of  AT2023wpm (ZTF23abovaur) in LEDA 1656929 (at z= 0.02394 as reported in NED). The target was supplied by ZTF, discovered by ALeRCE using the public ZTF stream. The observation was performed with the Asiago 1.82m Copernico Telescope (+ AFOSC; range 340-820 nm; resolution 1.4 nm). The  spectrum shares similarity with those of stripped-envelope SNe around  maximum light.
The classification was performed using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383).
