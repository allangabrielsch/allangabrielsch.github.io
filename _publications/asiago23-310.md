The Asiago Transient Classification Program (Tomasella et al. 2014, AN, 335, 841) reports the spectroscopic observation of AT2023xqn, AT2023xoo, AT2023wtm, AT2023xqw, AT2023xlm, AT2023vyn.

The observations were  obtained with the Asiago 1.82m Copernico Telescope (+ AFOSC; range 340-820 nm; resolution 1.4 nm).

SN2023xqn:  the spectrum is that of a Type Ia SN a week before maximum (host galaxy redshift z=0.0292035), in agreement with the classification of M. Gonzalez-Bañuelos et al. AstroNote 2023-309.

SN2023xoo: the noisy spectrum shows a broad Halpha line (v > 15000 km/s), reminiscent of type II SNe. 

SN2023wtm: the spectrum is that of a Type Ic SN, in agreement with the classification of Fulton et al. ( 2023TNSCR2978....1F ). A good match is found with SN 2004aw by assuming a redshift z=0.040, in disagreement with the redshift of the supposed host galaxy at z=0.023.

AT2023xqw: the spectrum shows hydrogen (Halpha, HBeta) and helium emission (HeII 4686 A) lines at zero redshift and it is consistent with a Galactic nova.

SN2023xlm: the spectrum resembles a 91T-like SN Ia at z=0.064. A good match is found with SN1998es about one week before maximum light.

SN2023vyn: the noisy spectrum shows a blue continuum with some undulations, consistent with a SN event (no convincing matches were found by GELATO).

The classifications were performed using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383) and SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) tools.

The Asiago classification spectra are posted at the website http://sngroup.oapd.inaf.it  and the IAU Transient Name Server.
