The Asiago Transient Classification Program (Tomasella et al. 2014, AN, 335, 841) reports the spectroscopic observations of AT2023xlu, AT2023xwi, AT2023xod, AT2023xlq, AT2023xxg, and AT2023xtf.

The observations were obtained with the Asiago 1.82m Copernico Telescope (+ AFOSC; range 340-820 nm; resolution 1.4 nm).

SN2023xlu: The spectrum shows a broad feature attributed to H-alpha superimposed on a blue continuum so we classify this transient as a Type II SN.

SN2023xwi: The spectrum is that of Ca-rich SN Ib. Next Generation SuperFit finds, for example, an excellent match with SN2016hgs at a phase of +6d after maximum light for redshifts z < 0.01. The remote location of SN2023xwi is consistent with the classification as a Ca-rich transient.

SN2023xod: GELATO finds excellent matches with the normal SNe Ia 2003kf and 2003du about 10d after maximum light. A redshift z ~ 0.095 is derived from the template matching.

SN2023xlq: The spectrum resembles that of normal SNe Ia at maximum light. GELATO finds a very good match with SN1989B at +2d.  A redshift z ~ 0.07 is derived from the template matching.

SN2023xxg: The spectrum is that of a normal SN Ia shortly after maximum light. GELATO finds, for example, a good match with 1990N at +2d.  A redshift z ~ 0.10 is derived from the template matching.

SN2023xtf: The spectrum strongly resembles those of high-velocity SNe Ia at early phases. GELATO finds convincing matches with SNe 2002dj and 2002bo around -10d. The reported redshift (z = 0.0355) is that of the host galaxy.

The classifications were performed using the GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383) and Next Generation SuperFit (2005ApJ...634.1190H, 2022TNSAN.191....1G) tools.
